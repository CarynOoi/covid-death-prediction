# covid-death-prediction
This is a practice project that focuses on training and evaluating prediction models for a dataset.

The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/). Two piece of data is extracted from CDC and merged together. Data is cleaned and analysed following the data quality plan produced. This project also focus on building and evluating prediction models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Model) that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target features. The outcome for the target feature is death_yn. 

The data cleaning and analysis process is done in DataPreparation.ipynb, with a Data_Quality_Report obtained. The model training notebook is done on DataAnalysisDataLearning.ipynb.
